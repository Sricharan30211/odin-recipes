    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Healthy recipe rich in calcium and protein content</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 + Â¼ cups water</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 + 2 tsp ghee / clarified butter</li>
        <li>1 cup + 2 tbsp raagi hittu / finger millet flour / kezhvaragu flour / nachani flour / ragulu flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To begin making the Ragi Mudde Recipe, heat 2-1/2 cups of water in a saucepan and add salt to it.</li>

        <li>Once it starts to boil, reduce the flame and add 3 tablespoons of ragi flour and whisk till there are no lumps formed and it slowly starts to thicken.</li>
        
        <li>Now, add the remaining ragi flour spoon by spoon and keep stirring so that there are no lumps.</li>
        
        <li>Make sure the heat is on low and ensure you keep stirring until it thickens completely. If you are making a larger quantity, then cover with a lid and leave the ragi aside to cook for about 5 minutes, until you notice it has thickened.</li>
        
        <li>Once you notice the ragi has thickened, continue stirring and add 2 tablespoons of ghee and keep stirring until you see the ragi has got a shine on it. It takes a good 10 minutes to make ragi mudde from 1 cup of ragi flour.</li>
        
        <li>Give the ragi mudde a taste and it should not feel raw.
        
        <li>In order to shape ragi mudde to balls, grease a bowl with oil or ghee. Place 2 large tablespoons of ragi mudde and start twirling it around till it forms a nice smooth ball. </li>
        
        <li>Once done, the ragi mudde can be served hot. Note that the ragi mudde needs to be shaped into a ball while it is hot. Using a small bowl, helps in shaping the ragi mudde.</li>
        
        <li>Serve the Ragi Mudde Recipe along with Chicken Saaru, or natukodipulusu to enjoy your lunch.</li>
